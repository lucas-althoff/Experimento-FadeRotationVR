# Experiment's webpage to recruit and schedule participants  
In October we will perform the experiment with at least 30 participants.

## Goals
Our branch of the project has the following goals:
- Propose new attention-driving mechanism for CVR;
- Study user behavior effects of the mechanism when using HMD;
- Study content effect in parametrization of the mechanism;
- Create a database with Spherical RoI annotation for story CVR;
- Propose an hybrid saliency-motion RoI ranking model;
- Develop an automatic content-based triggering solution for attention-driving techniques;
- Integrate with ABR scheme for 360-video streaming.
