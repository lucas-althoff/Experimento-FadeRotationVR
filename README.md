# PEE360: Perceptually Efficient Automatic Editing 360 Videos

This project has three main branches
- VR HMD Player with Streaming and Automatic Editing Solution
- Hybrid Saliency RoI Ranking in 360-degree Videos
- Multimodal Video Mining
- Multimodal RoI Extraction 
- Multi RoI Automatic Editing Solution Based in Adaptive Streaming Scheme 

This is a pre-print page of the actual Projects Research, sub projects performing the scientific project *PES360: Perceptually-Efficient Streaming of 360-degree Edited Videos*. Looking foward to stimulate active scientific collaboration this repository will register the links to find the key components of the project findings and works, as well as the *created datasets* and developed *source codes*.
